            <ol>
                <li>We will only give you the role to your business or add your item into the game once the payment has been received. </li>
                <li>All payments MUST be made through Paypal / Bank Transfer for the time being until we get a Tebex store up!</li>
                <li>Once payments have been finalized and the payment has been sent, there will be zero refunds given unless under extreme circumstances.</li>
                <li>Make sure that you certainly want the product you are going to purchase because it can <strong>NOT</strong> be changed after the item has been added to the server.</li>
                <li>There is NO going back once you have purchased something.</li>
                <li>If the server does get wiped, you <strong>WILL</strong> keep the business, car, or whatever you buy from our store.</li>
                <li>By purchasing, you agree to these rules and understand that <strong>all purchases are final.</strong></li>
